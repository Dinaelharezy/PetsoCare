If blood soaks through, add more material on top without removing the first layer. Elevate the wound above heart level if possible. For severe arterial bleeding (bright red, spurting blood), maintain pressure and seek immediate veterinary care."

Compress chest at 100-120 compressions per minute. Continue until the pet breathes independently or you reach veterinary care."

However, indoor living can become monotonous without proper enrichment. Creating a stimulating environment that satisfies natural feline instincts—hunting, climbing, scratching, and exploring—keeps indoor cats physically and mentally healthy."

Cats feel secure in elevated positions where they can survey their territory. Position perches near windows for bird-watching entertainment—many cats spend hours enjoying this 'cat TV.'"

Move the toy like real prey—quick darts, pauses, hiding behind furniture. Allow your cat to 'catch' the prey periodically, maintaining interest. Two 10-15 minute play sessions daily prevent boredom and obesity."

Start with easier puzzles, gradually increasing difficulty. Rotate toys weekly to maintain novelty. Hide small portions of food around the house, encouraging natural foraging behavior. This mental stimulation is especially important for food-motivated cats."

Provide multiple scratching posts in different materials (sisal, cardboard, carpet) and orientations (vertical posts, horizontal pads, angled). Place them near sleeping areas (cats love morning stretches) and high-traffic zones. Regularly refresh catnip on posts to maintain appeal. Never declaw—it's painful and causes behavioral problems."

Some cats enjoy leash training for supervised outdoor adventures. Always use a harness, never a collar, which cats can slip. Start training indoors before venturing outside."

Environmental enrichment isn't optional—it's essential for preventing behavior problems like aggression, destructive scratching, or inappropriate elimination.
